# Java Script Testing libraries

## What is a JavaScript Testing Framework Or library ?

its a set of tools used for automating the testing process of a JavaScript code.

## Why We must Test Our Codes ?

- Code optimization
  we have bottleneck in our code.and testing can help us to identify and remove these bottleneck!
  testing tools allow us to identify areas where the code is inefficient and make necessary changes to improve performance so we have better UX , faster load time for pages and more efficiency.

- Code integrity
  with testing tools we can prove our codes have'nt any bugs or errors and works properly.
  code that lacks integrity can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities.
- Happy developer
  it makes our project more agile. Whenever you add a new feature, you may have to change the old code. Changing a code that‚Äôs been tested already is costly and risky. However, if you run unit tests on the new code, you‚Äôll be confident that the new code won‚Äôt break any old feature.

## Three Levels of Test

1- **Unit Testing:**
unit test checks a single function or method in our code , in isolation from the rest of the application. Unit test help us catch errors early and ensure changes do not introduce new bugs or disrupt existing functionality.

2- **Integration Testing:**
Integration Test multiple units of code. combination of components (functions).It defines possible conflicts between application components.

3- **E2E Testing:**
end-to-end testing focuses on testing the overall app functionality. In this case, developers simulate real-world scenarios using special JS test tools and check whether the application operates as intended.

## Types of Testing Tools

### Test Runners

automate the execution of test cases and provide feedback on results. They can also generate reports and perform debugging. Popular test runners include Karma, Jest, Jasmine, and Cypress.

### Assertion libraries

help to ensure the code operates as expected. They are often used in unit testing and allow for time savings as they contain ready functions. Jasmine, Jest, and Cypress frameworks come with assertions included.

### Mocking tools

allow for the creation of fake objects and simulation of different scenarios. This enables quicker and safer integration and functional testing. Popular frameworks with mocking include Jest, Nightwatch, and Playwright.

### Browser test tools

automate JavaScript browser testing. They allow the simulation of user interactions such as clicking buttons and scrolling. Popular browser frameworks include Puppeteer, Cypress, and WebdriverIO.

### Test reporting tools

generate data on which automated tests pass or fail and streamline error detection. Most JavaScript test frameworks such as Mocha, Jasmine, Cypress, and Playwright include these tools.

### Test coverage tools

measure how much of the code was tested. This helps to find untested code and reduces the risk of undetected bugs. Frameworks like Jest, Cypress, and Storybook provide coverage reports by default.

### Visual regression tools

allow developers to obtain screenshots of the application‚Äôs UI before and after changes. This helps detect unintended changes and ensure UI consistency. Popular frameworks providing this feature are Puppeteer, Storybook, and Playwright.

## Finally the most important part : Jest Vs Mocha

### Installation

Jest

```js
npm install --save-dev jest
```

mocha

```js
 npm install --save-dev mocha
```

so simple isn't ?

### Witch one works better with React ?

I think The answer is JEST!
Jest was primarily developed for React and worked well with Next.js too.but Mocha is better suited for applications designed with Node.js.
what about another libraries? like Jasmine .it works better with Angular.js.

### What about UI-based applications ?

For powerful UI-based applications, Jest is a good choice. but For complex back-end applications, Mocha is a proper fit.

> Can I ask about Jasmine again?

absolutely ! Jasmine works better with light and simple projects.

### has Mocha built-in assertion libraries ?

unfortunately NOT!
you can switch to Jest.
jest have Built-in assertion libraries and auto-mocking BOTH!
or You can install external assertions like Chai.

And Jasmine ? jasmine also have assertion.

> Don't ask about Jasmine again and again and again we gonna talk about jest and mocha üòÅ

### What about Test runners? its an Important Part

yes it is. both mocha and jest has test runners Don't worry!

### Is Jest better than Mocha?

Whether Jest is better than Mocha depends on the specific needs of your project. Both are popular and capable testing frameworks that can do the job effectively.

- Jest is an all-in-one testing (if you want all this features in mocha you must install more libraries) framework with features like mocking, assertion, and code coverage analysis.
- While Mocha is a more lightweight framework that focuses on providing a flexible test runner and letting you choose your assertion library (Chai) and mocking library (sinon js) and code coverage (istanbul).
- Mocha provides more flexibility in configuration and integration with other tools, making it a better choice for projects with complex testing requirements.
- Mocha has been around longer than Jest, which means it has a more established user base and a larger collection of plugins and extensions.

## Conclusion

- If you want to compare Jest Vs Mocha based on speed, **Jest** is the winner.
- Among these two, Mocha is more flexible, but additional libraries must be installed for certain main features.
- Mocha has good capability for testing heavy and complex back-end applications.
- For UI testing, when it comes to Jest vs Mocha, Jest is preferred by many.
